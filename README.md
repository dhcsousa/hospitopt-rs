# hospitopt-rs
Rust-based optimization project that uses constraint programming to maximize the number of lives saved in emergency and healthcare scenarios. It models hospitals, diseases, available beds, ambulance positions and capacities, and patient needs, then computes optimized resource allocations to improve medical response and outcomes.
